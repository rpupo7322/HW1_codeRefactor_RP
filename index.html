            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows
                 anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. 
                 Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when
                  they search for your business.

                 helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right
